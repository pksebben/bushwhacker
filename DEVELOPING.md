# Developing Bushwhacker

There are a couple of commandments that must never be broken:
 - the base use-case, which is to pop a command in and see some useful
   output, shall never be made more complicated than 'import thing' =>
   'write small statement'.  Any fanciness must not interfere with
   this basic usage by adding the need for configuration or
   parammeters.
